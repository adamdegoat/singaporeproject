# Building Singapore, one district at a time

The goal: a real, navigable 3D Singapore you can ride and walk through, accurate
to the actual map, with detail that reads as the real place. Grown outward from
Orchard rather than blocked out all at once.

This file is the repeatable process. Orchard was built by hand and cost a lot of
rediscovery; nothing after it should.

---

## Adding a district

**1. Register it.** Add an entry to `data/districts.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "bugis",
  "name": "Bugis / Rochor",
  "bbox": "1.2960,103.8520,1.3030,103.8620",
  "origin": [1.29950, 103.85700],
  "axis": "victoria street",
  "status": "planned",
  "notes": "Shophouse-heavy"
}
```

- `bbox` is OSM order: **south,west,north,east**. Keep the long side under about
  1.2km or Overpass times out.
- `origin` is the local coordinate origin, ideally on the main street mid-way
  along it. Everything in that district is metres from this point.
- `axis` is the street the district is organised around, lowercase substring
  match. The whole dressing pass walks this axis, so pick the one you would ride.

**2. Build it.**

```
cd data && python3 build_district.py bugis
```

Fetches OSM in five small pieces with retries across four mirrors (a single
combined query times out — this is not optional), caches the raw response, then
runs the same `process.py` that built Orchard. Add `--force` to refetch.

**3. Gate it.**

```
python3 check.py bugis
```

Exits non-zero if it is not fit to ship. Every check exists because the matching
mistake actually shipped once:

| Check | The mistake it catches |
|---|---|
| No building under 3m | Four Seasons was tagged height 0 and lay flat on the ground |
| No 600 m²+ footprint under 8m | Liat Tower and Far East Shopping Centre were 3.5m |
| No sub-230 m² footprint over 16m | Untagged small footprints became a forest of needles through every back lane |
| Axis exists and is 250m+ | OSM splits streets into fragments; a failed stitch leaves nothing to dress and nowhere to spawn |
| Nothing in a real carriageway | 36 pieces of geometry sat in the road, including Ngee Ann City's plaza 8.5m into Orchard Road |
| Payload under 900 KB | It ships to a phone on mobile data |

**4. Correct what the gate cannot see.** Heights are the weak point: OSM tags are
missing or wrong for most buildings. Add real ones to `LANDMARKS` in
`process.py` for anything that carries recognition, then rebuild.

**5. Give the landmarks their real form.** Generic extrusions get the footprint
right and the silhouette wrong. Add a recipe in `src/landmarks.js` keyed by name.
**Research the building first** — published descriptions catch material, massing
and named features. That method corrected Ngee Ann City to African Red granite,
found its missing civic forecourt, and gave Wheelock Place its glass cone. It
cannot catch proportion or facade subdivision; that needs a photo or the user's
eye.

## The rules that keep it fast

Measured on a 2019 MacBook Pro with Iris Plus 645, which is the floor case. If it
runs there it runs anywhere.

- **The scene is fill-rate bound, not geometry bound.** Cutting pixels helps;
  cutting triangles barely does.
- **The shadow pass is where the frames go.** Kerbs, railings, road markings,
  planters and banners must have `castShadow = false`. That alone was 143k
  triangles a frame and 4fps.
- **Anything repeated is one `InstancedMesh`.** Per-object groups blew past 800
  draw calls immediately.
- **Parking an instance off-screen does not cull it.** The GPU draws every
  instance up to `.count`. Pack the visible ones into the front of the buffer and
  set `.count`. This halved triangles and gained 12fps. Per-instance colours must
  then be written per *slot*, not per entity index.
- **Merge geometry per material AND per ~110m spatial tile.** Merging globally
  defeats frustum culling: one mesh spanning the map is never culled, and
  framerate fell from 51 to 33.
- **`envMap` per material, never `scene.environment`.** Scene-wide makes tarmac
  and concrete sample the cube map for nothing.
- **Stay in daylight.** One sun lights the whole island for free. Night has to be
  authored per district, and realtime lights are the most expensive thing
  available here — 70 point lights once blew the shader's uniform budget and
  surfaces silently rendered black.

## Verifying

- Ride model: `node test/ride.test.mjs` — 18 assertions, no browser needed.
- Never trust a screenshot for behaviour. **Count the thing.** Zero pedestrians
  ever used a crossing while the code looked correct, because the handover ran
  one line before the crowd existed and the `if` guard swallowed it.
- Phone is the reference platform: 844x390 landscape, `?dpr=2` to force real
  phone pixel count, `?touch=1` to force touch.
- Useful flags: `?spec=x,y,z,tx,ty,tz` free camera, `?nofoliage`, `?nopeople`,
  `?notraffic`, `?noshadow`, `?nobuild` for bisecting a performance problem.

## Harness gotchas

- **Chrome throttles occluded windows to ~0fps**, which looks exactly like a
  catastrophic performance bug. Launch with
  `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows --disable-renderer-backgrounding
  --disable-features=CalculateNativeWinOcclusion`. Before blaming the scene, load
  a page that *was* fast.
- **A 60fps WebGL loop pegs two CPU cores.** Park the tab on `about:blank`
  between test rounds and kill the dev server. The page stops rendering when
  `document.hidden`.
- **Web Audio needs a buffer actually played inside a gesture on iOS**, not just
  `resume()`. Synthetic DOM events do not grant user activation; drive a real CDP
  mouse click to test it.
- Don't raycast to audit: it pegged a core for minutes and only sampled points.
  `audit_roads.py` tests whole edges against whole corridors, analytically.

## Deploying

```
npx esbuild src/main.js --bundle --format=esm --minify --outfile=build/app.js
# copy index.html (rewriting ./src/main.js to ./app.js), app.js and data/ to the repo root, push
```

Then verify by hash, not by eye:

```
shasum -a 256 dist/app.js
curl -s "https://adamdegoat.github.io/singaporeproject/app.js?cb=$RANDOM" | shasum -a 256
```

Equal means the served bundle is the one you built. Pages usually lands in under
a minute.
